# Wine Quality Dataset Analysis Assignment

#Objective:To load, explore, analyze, and visualize the Wine Quality dataset using the pandas and matplotlib libraries in Python.

## Overview

This assignment involves working with the Wine Quality dataset (specifically the red wine dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository). The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in:

* Loading data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
* Exploring the dataset's structure, data types, and identifying missing values.
* Performing basic data analysis, including calculating descriptive statistics and grouping data by a categorical variable.
* Creating informative visualizations using matplotlib to understand the data's characteristics and relationships between variables.
* Documenting the process and findings.

## Files Included

* `wine quality dataset.py`: The Python script containing the code for loading, exploring, analyzing, and visualizing the Wine Quality dataset.
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the assignment and instructions on how to run the code.
* `winequality-red.csv`: The red wine quality dataset used for this analysis (this file should be in the same directory as the script, or the path should be correctly specified in the code).

## Setup and Dependencies

To run the code in the submitted script, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

* pandas:For data manipulation and analysis. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```
* matplotlib: For creating basic plots and visualizations. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib
    ```
* seaborn: For creating more visually appealing statistical plots (optional, but used for one of the visualizations). You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install seaborn
    ```

It is recommended to have a Python environment (e.g., using Anaconda or virtualenv) set up to manage these dependencies.

## How to Run the Code

1.  Ensure the `winequality-red.csv` file is in the same directory** as your Python script (`wine quality dataset.py`). If it's not, you'll need to adjust the file path in the code accordingly.

2.  Run the Python script:
    *Open a terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the directory where you saved the `wine quality dataset.py` file.
    * Run the script using the Python interpreter:
        ```bash
        python "wine quality dataset.py"
        ```
    * The output (textual analysis results and the generated plots) will be displayed in the terminal or as separate window(s) depending on your environment.

## Assignment Tasks Covered

The submitted code addresses the following tasks as outlined in the assignment instructions:

Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset**
    * Loading the `winequality-red.csv` dataset using pandas.
    * Displaying the first few rows using `.head()`.
    * Exploring the dataset structure using `.info()`.
    * Checking for missing values using `.isnull().sum()`.
    * (No missing values were found in this dataset, so no explicit cleaning was needed in the code, but the check was performed).

Task 2: Basic Data Analysis**
    * Computing basic statistics of the numerical columns using `.describe()`.
    * Performing groupings on the 'quality' column and computing the mean of other numerical columns for each group using `.groupby()` and `.mean()`.
    * Identifying and noting patterns or interesting findings from the analysis.

Task 3: Data Visualization**
    * Creating a bar chart showing the average alcohol content per wine quality rating.
    * Generating a histogram to visualize the distribution of the 'pH' column.
    * Producing a scatter plot to explore the relationship between 'fixed acidity' and 'pH'.
    * Creating a box plot to compare the distribution of 'residual sugar' across different wine quality ratings.
    * Customizing plots with titles, labels for axes, and legends where necessary.

## Findings and Observations

The script includes comments and explanations of the findings observed during the data exploration, analysis, and visualization steps. Some initial observations include the trend of higher alcohol content in higher quality wines and the distribution of pH values. The scatter plot and box plot provide further insights into the relationships and distributions of different wine characteristics.

## Further Exploration 

While this submission covers the basic requirements, further exploration could involve:

* Analyzing the white wine dataset and comparing it to the red wine dataset.
* Combining the red and white wine datasets and adding a feature to distinguish them.
* Exploring correlations between different features.
* Investigating the distribution of the 'quality' variable itself.
* Trying different types of visualizations to uncover more insights.
